-- 2. Import an EFC list (CSV or Excel read in the browser, sent here as JSON rows). Grading staff and admins only.
-- Each row may have: member_id, reference, full_name, first_name, last_name, dob, belt, location, phone, email,
-- guardian_name, programme, status, promoted_on, classes (since last grading), attendance_total, last_attended.
-- A row matches a student by EFC member ID, then EFC reference, then name + date of birth. Blank cells leave what's there.
-- Medical notes and balances are never stored.
